Within the object, the Time model does fit\nand store all the peaks it detects. However, without some definition of how to store and\nvisualize the peaks, the object cannot visualize the results across time.\n\nWe can therefore use the :class:`~.Bands` object to define oscillation bands of interest.\nBy doing so, the Time model object will organize peaks based on these band definitions,\nso we can plot, for example, alpha peaks across time windows.\n\n\n"

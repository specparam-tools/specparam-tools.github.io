Candidate\npeaks are extracted in order of decreasing height, until some stopping criterion is met,\nwhich is controlled by the following settings:\n\n**max_n_peaks (int)** default: infinite\n\nThe maximum number of peaks that can be extracted from a given power spectrum. The algorithm\nwill halt searching for new peaks when this number is reached. Note that peaks are extracted\niteratively by height (over and above the aperiodic component), and so this approach will\nextract (up to) the *n* largest peaks.\n\n**peak_threshold (relative threshold - standard deviation of power spectrum)** default: 2.0\n\nThe threshold, in terms of standard deviation of the aperiodic-removed power\nspectrum, above which a data point must pass to be considered a candidate peak.\nOnce a candidate peak drops below this threshold, the peak search is halted (without\nincluding the most recent candidate).\n\n**min_peak_height (absolute threshold - units of log power)** default: 0\n\nThe minimum height, above the aperiodic fit, that a peak must have to be extracted\nin the initial fit stage. This threshold is defined in units of log power. Once a\ncandidate peak drops below this threshold, the peak search is halted (without including\nthe most recent candidate). Note that because this constraint is enforced during peak search,\nand prior to final peak fit, returned peaks are not guaranteed to surpass this value in height.\n\nThere are two different height-related halting conditions for the peak searching.\nBy default, the relative (standard-deviation based) threshold is defined, whereas the\nabsolute threshold is set to zero (this default is because there is no general way to\nset this value without knowing the scale of the data). If both are defined, both are\nused and the peak search will halt when a candidate peak fails to pass either the absolute,\nor relative threshold.\n\n#### Verbosity\n\n**verbose (boolean)** default='True'\n\nWhether to print out status updates and warnings.\n\n\n"

        "### Organizing Data into 3D Objects\n\nElectrophysiological data typically has multiple dimensions including, for example,\nthe number of subjects, the number of channels and/or recording regions, the number\nof conditions, and/or the number of trials.\n\nThis often means that we organize our data into multi-dimensional arrays.\n\nSo, for example, a 3D array of power spectra could reflect:\n\n- power spectra across task conditions, as [n_conditions, n_channels, n_freqs]\n- power spectra across data epochs within subjects, as [n_epochs, n_channels, n_freqs]\n- power spectra across a group of subjects, as [n_subjects, n_channels, n_freqs]\n- power spectra across regions, as [n_regions, n_channels, n_freqs]\n\nIf you do have data that is or can be organized into 3D arrays, here we will\nexplore how to fit, manage, and organize this data.\n\nA reminder that no matter how the data is organized, it's always the exact same model\nthat is fit. All other objects or organizations use the same code to do the fitting.\nFor example, the SpectralGroupModel object inherits from SpectralModel, and calls the\nsame underlying fit function.\n\nAs we'll see, we can fit 3D arrays of spectra by distributing SpectralGroupModel objects\nacross the data, which also uses the same underlying code.\n\n\n"

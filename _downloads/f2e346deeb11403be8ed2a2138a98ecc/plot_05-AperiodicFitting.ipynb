Since 1/f is a straight line in log-log spacing, this approach captures\n1/f activity.\n\nThis is equivalent to the power spectrum model in this module, when fitting with no knee,\nwith a direct relationship between the slope ($a$) and the exponent ($\\chi$):\n\n\\begin{align}\\chi = -a\\end{align}\n\n\n"

If fitting is done in the 'fixed' mode,\nbut the assumption of a single 1/f is violated, then fitting will go wrong.\n\nBroad frequency ranges (typically ranges greater than ~40 Hz range) typically do not\nhave a single 1/f, as assumed by 'fixed' mode, as they typically exhibit a 'bend' in\nthe aperiodic component. This indicates that there is not a single 1/f property across\nall frequencies, but rather a 'bend' in the aperiodic component.

We use the option\nof adding a knee parameter, since even though neural data is often discussed in terms\nof having `1/f` activity, there is often not a single `1/f` characteristic, especially\nacross broader frequency ranges. Therefore, using this function form allows for modeling\nbends in the power spectrum of the aperiodic component, if and when they occur.\n\nNote that if we were to want the equivalent function in linear power, using $AP$\nto indicate the aperiodic component in linear spacing, it would be:\n\n\\begin{align}AP(F) = 10^b * \\frac{1}{(k + F^\\chi)}\\end{align}\n\n\n"

        "## Choosing an Aperiodic Fit Mode\n\nIt is important to choose the appropriate aperiodic fitting approach for your data.\n\nIf there is a clear knee in the power spectrum, fitting in 'fixed' mode will not\nwork well. However fitting with a knee may perform sub-optimally in ambiguous cases\n(where the data may or may not have a knee), or if no knee is present.\n\nGiven this, we recommend:\n\n- Check your data, across the frequency range of interest,\n  for what the aperiodic component looks like.\n\n  - If it looks roughly linear (in log-log space), fit without a knee.\n\n    - This is likely across smaller frequency ranges, such as 3-30.\n    - Do not perform no-knee fits across a range in which this does not hold.\n  - If there is a clear knee, then use knee fits.\n\n    - This is likely across larger fitting ranges such as 1-150 Hz.\n- Be wary of ambiguous ranges, where there may or may not be a knee.\n\n  - Trying to fit without a knee, when there is not a single consistent aperiodic component,\n    can lead to very bad fits. However, trying to fit with a knee may lead to suboptimal fits\n    when no knee is present, and makes interpreting the exponent more difficult.\n\n    - We therefore currently recommend picking frequency ranges in which the expected\n      aperiodic component process is relatively clear.\n\n\n"

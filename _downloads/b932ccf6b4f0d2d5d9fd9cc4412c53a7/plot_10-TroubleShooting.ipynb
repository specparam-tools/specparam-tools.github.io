        "## Algorithm Settings\n\nWith default settings, the power spectrum model is relatively minimally constrained. It\ndefaults as such since there are not universal settings that work across all different\nrecording modalities. Appropriate settings also vary with power spectrum quality (noise,\nor effectively, the smoothness of the power spectrum), and frequency ranges.\n\nFor any given dataset, you will likely have to tune some of the algorithm settings\nfor optimal performance.\n\nTo do so, we suggest using a combination of the following considerations:\n\n- A priori constraints, given your data, such as the number of peaks you expect to extract\n- Qualitative analysis, guided by examining the the plotted model fit results,\n  as compared to input data\n- Quantitative analysis, considering the model goodness of fit metrics\n  (however, see note at the bottom regarding interpreting these metrics)\n\nChoosing settings to tune model fitting is an imperfect art, and should be done carefully,\nas assumptions built into the settings chosen will impact the model results. Model\nfitting is generally not overly sensitive to small changes in the settings, so as long\nas broadly appropriate settings are chosen, small perturbations to these chosen settings\nshould not have a large impact on the fitting.\n\nWe do recommend that model settings should not be changed between power spectra\n(across channels, trials, or subjects), if they are to be meaningfully compared.\nWe therefore recommend first testing fitting the model across some representative\nspectra, in order to select settings, which you then keep constant for the full analysis.\n\n\n"

Otherwise, the model is unlikely to\nappropriately fit power spectra as having no peaks, since it uses only a relative\nthreshold if ``min_peak_height`` is set to zero (which is the default value).\nSetting ``min_peak_height`` requires checking the scale of your power spectra,\nallowing you to define an absolute threshold for extracting peaks.\n\n\n"
